I. Why Learn Typescript?
1. Confidence
    - checks codee at compile time/live before it ever gets deployed. Thus, reducing runtime errors.
2. Productivity
  - turns on a number of neat features that make your life as a developer a LOT easier. Autocomplete, refactoring, immediate error checking.
3. Employability
  - Typescript is considered 'table stakes' by many companies, even if it isn't explicitly listed in job descriptions. Knowing even a little typescript can set you apart from other junior developer candidates.

!!. Objectives
- Basic literal, and custom typescript
- optional properties
- unions
